## How to become a creator

Becoming a creator on openAR is straightforward. Simply upload your work to the platform. No invitation is required, but you must register and create an artist profile to publish your artwork.

You have the option to publish your artwork on the platform without selling it, or to mint it as an NFT (transferred to IPFS, a decentralised peer-to-peer storage network), set a price in xDai, and put it up for sale on openAR. To do this, connect and set up your MetaMask wallet.

## Publishing Artworks

To publish your artwork or mint it for sale, follow these steps after registering and creating your profile:

    Complete your profile with a valid email address and accept the Terms of Service.
    Fill out the artwork information (title, description).
    Upload your augmented reality objects in USDZ and GLB formats (max size 20MB).
    Upload a preview thumbnail for your artwork (jpg or png).

### Restrict access to artwork based on geolocation

openAR now allows creators to restrict access to artwork objects based on geolocation. Assign specific latitude and longitude coordinates to each artwork object, directing users to the exact location to experience the AR artwork.

This feature enables artists to embed digital creations into physical spaces, providing audiences with an immersive, location-specific experience of augmented reality art.

## Mint artworks as NFT (legacy feature)

Optionally, you can mint your artwork as NFT and sell it on openAR. Login with a crypto wallet (legacy login) to mint your artwork:

 - Make sure the metadata is correct before minting, as changes will incur transaction fees.
 - Select 'edit artwork' then 'minting.'
 - Decide on artwork price and edition size (note: cannot be changed after minting).

**Important:** There are no fees for minting and listing artwork. However, changing NFT details will incur a transaction fee. To delete or burn a minted NFT, contact our Admin at contact@openAR.art.
