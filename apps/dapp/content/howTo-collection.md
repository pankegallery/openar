## Start your collection

On openAR anyone can create a profile to start collecting NFTs. All youâ€™ll need is a MetaMask wallet and xDAI, the cryptocurrency used to pay for all transactions on the platform. When you buy an NFT, the artwork gets transferred to your wallet and appears on your openAR collector profile.

You can choose to publish your collection to be viewed by other visitors on the platform or keep it private. In accordance to our [Terms of Service](/p/tanc), you can display your purchased art outside the platform and share it on social media.
