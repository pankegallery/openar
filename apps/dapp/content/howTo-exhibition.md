## Empowering curators and institutions 

We believe that art needs context to be meaningful. Digital platforms have a tendency to overflow with content. Instead of navigating this content with a biased algorithm, we trust in the expertise of human curators. openAR allows anyone to create an exhibition and share it with the world via the front page.


openAR offers a unique opportunity for institutions and curators to utilise the platform as a powerful tool for creating and presenting immersive exhibitions. Through this feature, exhibitions can be curated in specific locations, transforming ordinary spaces into immersive galleries of digital art.

## Plans to implement the exhibitions feature

openAR is dedicated to continuously enhancing its features to facilitate the seamless addition of exhibitions. Currently, the platform is in the process of implementing an exhibition feature that will allow institutions and curators to effortlessly showcase curated collections in specific locations. This feature will provide a user-friendly interface to ensure a streamlined process for adding and managing exhibitions.

## How to add an exhibition

As of now, the exhibition feature is in its developmental stage. To add an exhibition to openAR in the meantime, please contact the [platform administrators](mailto:contact@openAR.art). They will guide you through the process and provide you with a form to submit all the necessary information.

Stay tuned for updates on the exhibition feature, as openAR continues to evolve to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly experience for institutions, curators, and art enthusiasts.
